# Obsidian Prettier Plugin

This is a formatting plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It uses the built-in settings for tabs and tab spacing so it doesn't require configuration.

# Installation

Unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/dylanarmstrong/obsidian-prettier-plugin/releases/latest) into `.obsidian/plugins` folder of your vault.

# Usage

Format on save is enabled by default, and can be changed under plugin settings.

Additionally, a "Format current file" command is available.

# Customization

This plugin only provides two options to prettier, namely tabWidth and useTabs. They are taken via the Editor settings. Beyond that, there's no customization provided.
